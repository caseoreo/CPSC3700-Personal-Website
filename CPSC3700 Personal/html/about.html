  <p class = "about-text">
    Born in Hawaii, I am currently a Design student at Seattle University. I’m interested in all types of digital design, such as UX/UI and web design as well as graphic design. <br> <br>
    The medium I enjoy working in the most is the digital medium, whether that be photography, photoshop, illustrator, etc. I’m constantly striving to improve my techniques, expand my skillset and find new opportunities to grow. Each of my projects - both solo and collaborative - has allowed me to grow and form my identity as a designer. <br> <br>
    Please enjoy my portfolio, and feel free to get in touch with any questions. <br>
