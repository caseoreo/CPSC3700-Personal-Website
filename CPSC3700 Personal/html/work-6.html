    Drawing with random objects. This drawing was made using graphite and charcoal. This is a drawing of a box, chlorox wipe bottle, a chair, a small towel and headphones. I wanted to challenge myself since drawing isn't a medium I normally create in. I got these objects and tried to put them together in a composition that I thought was interesting. I liked the headphones because the cord acted as a leading line leading the eye throughout the rest of the image.<br>
