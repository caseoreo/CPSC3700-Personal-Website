    Concept Horror Book Cover. This book cover was inspired by many other horror designs. I noticed that many horror designs used serif typefaces and so I tested out many different ones before settling for the one I used. Furthermore, I wanted to give most of the elements like the key and the main title a carved wood feel so I experimented with masking effects and other effects.<br>
